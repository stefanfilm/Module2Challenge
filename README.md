# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

My motivation for creating this site was to make a portfolio to showcase my software development work to employers. I built this project to create a portfolio to showcase my best work to future employers. The site solves the problem of not having a dedicated site to showcase my developer projects. I learned how to create images with links and advanced CSS.

## Deployed Site

https://stefanfilm.github.io/Module2Challenge/

## Installation

To install my project, please visit https://github.com/stefanfilm/Module2Challenge 

Clone the repository to your local. 

Open the repository in a code editor. 

Access the HTML and CSS files to get the development environment running. 

## Usage

The site functions as a portfolio website. You could add a link to the portfolio project and upload a featured image.
